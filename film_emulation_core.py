"""Pure-torch core for optional film emulation, the last stage of the pipeline.

Film emulation makes a finished render look shot on film. ``emulate`` runs the
stages in the order light meets them: the optical stages (``optics``: softness,
halation, bloom, all in linear light, then the highlight roll-off), then film
grain (``add_grain``), which sits in the emulsion and so comes last. Each
optical stage has a strength 0..100, 0 = off. A detected white photo border is
left out of every stage: the optics run on the picture rectangle only, so paper
never glows into the picture. Grain is described below.

No ComfyUI / Forge imports, so the same file drives every host and the offline
tests. The three image helpers are copied from vae_enhance_core.py on purpose:
each host loads the cores by file path under a private module name, so a bare
import between them would fail in Forge.

What it does
------------
Adds a seeded, spatially correlated, luminance-weighted noise field to the
colour channels of a finished image. Two controls, deliberately orthogonal:

* ``iso`` picks a preset that sets the grain's *character*: blob radius,
  tail-heaviness (fine film sums to Gaussian, fast film clumps) and how much
  colour grain a colour image gets. It changes the amplitude only to keep the
  perceived amount the same: coarse grain reads louder, so ``ISO_LOUDNESS``
  scales each preset to look as loud as ISO 400 (matched by eye).
* ``strength`` 0..100 sets the *amplitude* alone, in /255 units of midtone
  luma: 0.3 at 1 (under the midtone just-noticeable difference of ~3/255),
  3.3 at 50 (at threshold: reads as texture, not noise), 8 at 100 (grainy).
* ``match_texture`` (default on) keeps the *perceived* amount predictable.
  Texture an image already carries masks added grain (contrast masking: the
  visibility threshold rises with the masker's contrast, slope ~0.6 above
  threshold, Legge & Foley 1980). A clean render shows every bit of the
  grain, so it gets exactly the strength's amount; a textured or already
  grainy render gets more, (floor / 1.1) ** 0.6, at most 1.4x and at most
  12/255, so the grain stays as visible as it is on a clean image. It never
  reduces the amount: an earlier version scaled grain *down* on clean images
  and made strength 50 invisible on exactly the renders that need grain.

Why it looks like film and not like sensor noise:

* **Correlated.** White noise has zero neighbour correlation; grain clumps
  span 1-3 px. A Gaussian-blurred field at the preset sigma, renormalised,
  gives a lag-one autocorrelation of ~0.3-0.6 and reads as grain. The sigma
  grows with the *square root* of the image's long side (reference 1536 px).
  Fully frame-anchored scaling made the same preset 1.5x coarser at 1536 than
  at 1024 when viewed at 1:1, which is how grain is judged; fully
  pixel-anchored scaling would make a large image's grain vanish in a
  fit-to-screen view. The square root splits the difference.
* **Grain size follows exposure.** On film only the largest, most sensitive
  crystals develop where little light arrived, so shadows and underexposed
  areas show sparse, coarse, clumpy grain; where much light arrived crystals of
  every size develop and overlap into fine grain. The field is blurred twice
  from the same noise, coarse (preset sigma x 1.35) and fine (/ 1.35), and the
  two are blended per pixel by luminance, renormalised so only the size and
  clumpiness change, never the amount.
* **Amount follows tone, by film type.** ``film`` = "print" (default: the
  model renders prints and reversal slides) puts the most grain in the darks
  (1.75x the midtone amount at luma 0.10), less in the mids, little in the brights and
  none on pure black or pure white. "negative" (a negative scan) puts more in
  the highlights, where a scan of the dense negative is noisiest. The amount
  is never more than about half the pixel's distance to black or white, so
  grain never clips into raised blacks.
* **No grain on paper.** A uniform band along at least three image edges (a
  Polaroid or print border, a film-scan rebate) is detected and left
  bit-exact; inside the picture, flat near-white areas (paper white, a blown
  flat highlight) get none either. Grain lives in the emulsion, not on paper.
* **Luma grain is exactly neutral.** The same value is added to R, G and B, so
  a grey pixel stays grey to the last bit.
* **Colour grain never invents a hue.** It is a *multiplicative* fluctuation of
  each pixel's existing chroma vector, so its size is proportional to the
  pixel's own saturation: a neutral pixel gets exactly none, a faint tint gets
  a faint fluctuation of that tint, a saturated red gets visible colour grain,
  and the hue never moves. A frame whose mean chroma is under 8/255 (a "B&W"
  decode with a slight cast) is detected as monochrome and gets no colour
  grain at all. ``chroma`` = "auto" | "on" | "off".

Judge the result at 1:1. A downscaled preview hides grain, 2:1 exaggerates it.
