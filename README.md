# ComfyUI-DeGrid

Three post-processing tools for images from diffusion models, one repo, three hosts: ComfyUI, Forge Neo and SwarmUI. Every host runs the same maths files.

## Overview

- **VAE DeGrid (Nyquist Notch)** removes the 2 px pixel grid that the Qwen Image VAE, and to a lesser extent the Wan 2.1 VAE, leaves across decoded images: Krea 2, Qwen Image, Qwen Image 2.1, Anima and anything else built on those VAEs. The grid is easy to miss at 100 % zoom, reads worst in flat, dark areas, and any sharpening or upscaling afterwards amplifies it. The notch erases it exactly and calibrates itself, so there is nothing to tune. Its chapters run from [Install (ComfyUI)](#install-comfyui) to [Swapping the decoder instead](#swapping-the-decoder-instead).
- **VAE Enhance (Flux.2 round trip)**, optional, re-draws fine texture (skin pores, fur, hair) by pushing the finished image through a Flux.2 VAE. See [VAE Enhance](#vae-enhance-flux2-round-trip).
- **Film Emulation**, optional, makes the final image look shot on film: grain whose size and amount follow exposure, plus softness, halation, bloom and highlight roll-off. See [Film emulation](#film-emulation).

On the final image they run in that order, and each works without the others.

## Front ends

One repo, one set of maths (`degrid_core.py`), several hosts:

| Host | Where it lives | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ComfyUI | `__init__.py` at the repo root (node **VAE DeGrid (Nyquist Notch)**) | shipped |
| Forge Neo | `scripts/degrid_forge.py` + `lib_degrid/` (accordion **VAE DeGrid**) | shipped, see [Forge Neo](#forge-neo) |
| SwarmUI | `DeGridExtension.cs` + `assets/` (parameter group **VAE DeGrid**) | shipped, see [SwarmUI](#swarmui) |

A second, optional tool lives in the same repo: **VAE Enhance**, which re-draws fine texture (skin pores, fur, hair) by pushing the finished image through a Flux.2 VAE. Same maths file for every host (`vae_enhance_core.py`), see [VAE Enhance](#vae-enhance-flux2-round-trip).

| Host | Where it lives | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ComfyUI | node **VAE Enhance (Flux.2 round trip)** in `__init__.py` | shipped |
| Forge Neo | `scripts/vae_enhance_forge.py` + `lib_degrid/flux2_vae.py` (accordion **VAE Enhance (Flux.2 round trip)**) | shipped |
| SwarmUI | same `DeGridExtension.cs` (parameter group **VAE Enhance**) | shipped, see [SwarmUI](#swarmui) |

A third, also optional: **Film Emulation**, the last stage before saving: film grain plus softness, halation, bloom and highlight roll-off (`film_emulation_core.py`), see [Film emulation](#film-emulation).

| Host | Where it lives | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ComfyUI | node **Film Emulation** in `__init__.py` | shipped |
| Forge Neo | `scripts/film_emulation_forge.py` (accordion **Film emulation**) | shipped |
| SwarmUI | same `DeGridExtension.cs` (parameter group **Film Emulation**) | shipped, see [SwarmUI](#swarmui) |

Cloning the repo into a host's extension folder is enough; each host only loads its own entry point and ignores the others.

## Install (ComfyUI)

```
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/lunaaispace-eng/ComfyUI-DeGrid
```

No dependencies beyond torch (no OpenGL/GLFW — works headless). Restart ComfyUI and search for **degrid**. The notch needs nothing else; the optional [VAE Enhance](#vae-enhance-flux2-round-trip) node needs a Flux.2 VAE file (`flux2-vae.safetensors`, 336 MB) in `models/vae`.

> **Do not install this alongside [ComfyUI-SaveSimple](https://github.com/lunaaispace-eng/ComfyUI-SaveSimple).**
> That pack bundles the same node under the same id (`VAEDeGrid`), so having both
> installed is a node-id collision. Pick one: this repo if you only want the grid
> fix, SaveSimple if you already use the rest of that suite.

## Quick start

1. Wire **VAE Decode → VAE DeGrid → (everything else)**. It must sit *before* any sharpening, deconvolution, or upscaling — those amplify the grid, so remove it first.
2. Leave the defaults. `auto` mode measures each image and calibrates itself.
3. Run once. The node displays a status line, e.g.:

   ```
   grid 2.10/255 (checker) — removed (limit 0.019 auto) · edges protected 1.2%
   ```

   That readout is your confirmation it worked — you don't need to pixel-peep. On an image that has no grid you get this instead, and nothing is changed:

   ```
   grid 0.16/255 — none detected, passed through untouched · edges protected 0.0%
   ```

> **Order matters more than it looks.** Put this straight after `VAE Decode`,
> *before* any resize, and before a diffusion restorer/upscaler such as SeedVR2.
> A half-scale resize will hide the lattice from your eyes, but the restorer has
> already been handed it — and a restorer reads a regular lattice as detail worth
> reconstructing. Degridding after the upscaler is too late; the node will tell
> you there is nothing left to remove.

## Settings

| Widget | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | on | Off = the image passes through completely untouched. Flip it for a quick A/B comparison. |
| `mode` | `auto` | **auto (recommended):** measures the grid strength and sets the removal limit itself — nothing to tune, adapts to different VAEs and content. Calibrated per 256px tile: each tile starts from a robust guess and raises its limit, in 1.5× steps up to 0.05, until the lattice left there is under half the `threshold`; the tile limits are blended into a smooth per-pixel map. A flat sky stays near 0.005 while textured ground climbs to 0.05, so regions with little grid are not clamped as hard as the regions that need it. **manual:** uses the `limit` widget everywhere instead. Only switch if auto visibly under- or over-corrects. |
| `limit` | 0.02 | **Manual mode only** (ignored in auto). Maximum per-pixel correction on the 0–1 scale. The VAE grid is usually 0.005–0.02. Too low → grid partially survives in contrasty areas. Too high → fine 2–3px texture (skin pores, fabric weave) gets slightly softened. |
| `skip_when_clean` | on | Leave the image completely untouched when no grid is actually there. The node measures the lattice directly, so anything that has already been through an upscaler or a resize is passed through **bit-for-bit**. Turn it off only to force the filter to run regardless. |
| `grid_gain` | 10 | Brightness amplification of the `removed_grid` preview **only** — never affects the cleaned image. Raise it if the preview looks like flat gray. |
| `grid_view` | `4x zoom` | Framing of the `removed_grid` preview. `full frame` shows the whole image (reads as gray noise at preview size — see below). `4x zoom` / `8x zoom` show a magnified center crop where the actual 2px lattice is visible. Preview only; the cleaned image is never cropped. |
| `threshold` | 0.5 | Optional. Lattice amplitude in /255 units below which an image counts as clean and is passed through. Native Qwen-VAE decodes measure 0.5–2.5, resized or upscaled images 0.1–0.2. Lower it (0.3) if a model you know is gridded reports `none detected`. |

RGBA images (the Qwen Image 2.1 VAE decodes to four channels) are filtered on their colour channels only; alpha is passed through untouched and takes no part in the measurement.

### Status line

After each run the node shows what it measured:

- **`grid X/255 (orientation)`** — the measured lattice amplitude, peak-to-peak. The raw Qwen-VAE grid is typically 1–5/255 (measured on Qwen Image 2.1 decodes: 1.6–2.0/255). Below 0.5/255 the node reports **none detected** and passes the image through untouched. The orientation in brackets — `checker`, `V-stripe` or `H-stripe` — is whichever component dominates.

  This is a *phase-locked* measurement, not a percentile of the filter's own output. The grid's phase is tied to the VAE's output stride, so it is constant across the frame: averaging the four `(y%2, x%2)` sublattices keeps the grid while genuine detail cancels. That matters, because "how much high-frequency content is in this image" is not the same question as "is there a grid", and answering the first one gets it backwards on a busy image.
- **`limit N (auto|manual)`** — the correction cap that was applied. In auto mode this is a range, e.g. `limit 0.010-0.050 auto`: the lowest and highest tile limits in the image.
- **`partially removed, X/255 left`** — the cap was lower than the grid's own amplitude, so part of the lattice survived. The node measures what is left in the cleaned image rather than assuming the notch got it all. Raise the limit (or go back to `auto`).
- **`edges protected N%`** — percentage of pixels where the correction hit the cap. Those are real edges/detail being passed through unsoftened. A few percent is normal; a very high number means lots of legitimate high-frequency content (or a manual limit set too low).

## Reading the removed_grid preview

**"It's just gray noise — is it even doing anything?"** Yes. That is exactly what success looks like, and here is why: the artifact is a 2-pixel pattern. A node preview shows a 1728px image at a few hundred pixels wide, so a 2px lattice is far below what the thumbnail can render — it aliases into uniform gray "noise". The information is real; the zoom level just can't show it.

Two ways to actually see it:

- Set `grid_view` to `4x zoom` or `8x zoom` (default is 4x): the preview becomes a magnified center crop and the regular lattice pattern is plainly visible.
- Or open the preview image at 100%+ zoom.

What to look for:

| removed_grid shows | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Uniform fine grid / speckle, brighter over textured areas | Working correctly |
| Nearly flat gray | Little or no grid in this image (check the status line — likely `none detected`) |
| Recognizable faces, fabric, edges | Limit too high — switch to manual and lower `limit` |

A faint silhouette of the subject is normal (the artifact is slightly stronger over detailed areas). Recognizable *detail* is not.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Grid still visible in contrasty areas after filtering | `mode: manual`, raise `limit` toward 0.03–0.04 |
| Fine texture (pores, weave) looks softened | `mode: manual`, lower `limit` toward 0.01 |
| Status says `none detected` but you see a grid | The grid may be coming from a later node (sharpener, upscaler) — this node only fixes what the VAE decode produced. Check the chain order. If the image reached this node via a resize, the resize has already scrambled the lattice; move the node earlier. |
| You want it to filter anyway | Turn `skip_when_clean` off. The status line then reads `none detected, filtered anyway`. |
| removed_grid looks like flat gray | Raise `grid_gain`, or the image simply has no grid |

## Forge Neo

The same filter as a [Forge Neo](https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-forge-classic/tree/neo) extension, for the Wan-VAE models Forge Neo runs (Krea 2, Qwen Image, Wan, Anima).

```
cd <forge-neo>/extensions
git clone https://github.com/aoleg/ComfyUI-DeGrid
```

Restart the webui. A **VAE DeGrid** accordion appears on the txt2img and img2img tabs, off by default. Tick it and generate; the console prints one line per VAE decode, e.g.

```
DeGrid: 1536x1536 | grid 2.54/255 (V-stripe) - removed (limit 0.010 auto) | edges protected 2.9%
```

and the same verdict is written into the image's parameters as `DeGrid result`.

### Where it runs, and why that matters

In Forge the filter is not an image post-process. The extension replaces the checkpoint's VAE, for the duration of each sampling pass, with a wrapper that runs the notch inside every decode. Two things follow:

- **Hires fix is handled correctly.** Forge decodes the first pass and hands the pixels straight to the hires upscaler with no extension hook in between. An image-level hook would leave the grid under the upscaler, exactly the case the ComfyUI section above warns about. Decode-level filtering cleans the first pass *before* the upscaler sees it, then the final decode again. Latent-space hires upscalers only decode once, at the end, which is also covered.
- **Nothing else changes.** Encoding (img2img, inpainting, hires re-encode) is the checkpoint's own, untouched. The wrapper shares the loaded VAE weights, so there is no second model in memory, and tiled decoding and the out-of-memory fallback go through the same filter. Any extension that installs its own VAE subclass (e.g. an upscaling decoder) still works: its decode runs first and the notch runs on its output, where it will usually find nothing to remove.

A measured 2px lattice from the real Forge Neo Krea 2 decodes used to validate this: 1.4 to 2.5/255 before, 0.05 to 0.2/255 after. The same images generated with a Flux VAE measure 0.07 to 0.09/255 and are passed through untouched.

### Controls

| Control | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Mode | `auto` | Same as the node's `mode`: `auto` measures each image and sets the removal limit; `manual` uses the slider. |
| Limit (manual mode) | 0.02 | Same as the node's `limit`; ignored in `auto`. |
| Skip when clean | on | Same as the node's `skip_when_clean`. |
| Clean threshold (/255) | 0.5 | New in Forge: the lattice amplitude below which an image counts as clean and is left alone. Forge Neo Krea 2 decodes have measured as low as 0.47/255, just under the default, so lower it (0.3) if the console reports `none detected` on a model you know is gridded. Raise it to be more conservative. |
| Show removed grid | off | Adds a magnified centre crop of the subtracted component to the results, one per final image, so you can see the lattice without pixel-peeping. |
| Preview zoom, Preview gain | `8x`, 10 | Framing and brightness of that preview only; the cleaned image is never affected. |

Settings are saved to the image parameters as `DeGrid: mode=auto;skip=1;threshold=0.5` (plus `limit=` in manual mode) and restore from the paste button.

### Notes

- **Order relative to other decode-side extensions.** DeGrid installs its VAE wrapper early (`sorting_priority = 10`), so an extension that swaps the VAE later, such as Neo VAE Utils, replaces the wrapper rather than being wrapped by it. Its decode then runs without DeGrid, which is the right outcome for an upscaling decoder that already averages the grid away.
- **Batches.** Each image in a batch is measured and limited on its own. The console line carries `[i/n]`; the parameters carry the first image's verdict.
- **Interrupted runs.** The swap is scoped to one sampling pass by Forge itself and is additionally undone at the end of every run and at the start of the next, so an interrupted generation cannot leave the wrapper installed.
- **Tests.** `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` from the repo root, with any venv that has torch, numpy and Pillow. No Forge checkout or checkpoint is needed; the hook wiring, the decode topology (direct, tiled, OOM fallback), the hires double pass and the parameter round trip are all covered offline.

## Swapping the decoder instead

A recurring suggestion is to avoid the grid by not using the Qwen decoder at all. Two versions of that idea, measured:

**A different VAE family (Flux, Flux 2) does not fit.** Krea 2, Qwen Image and Wan read and write the 16-channel Wan latent space. Every step that samples with one of those models must encode with the Qwen/Wan encoder and decode with a Wan-latent decoder, so a Flux VAE can only ever be used for a pure encode-decode round trip with no sampling in between. That round trip removes the 2px lattice because the pattern cannot pass the bottleneck, but it also re-synthesizes every other 2-4px detail through a different decoder. The notch removes only the 2px band and adds nothing.

**A different decoder for the same latent space does work.** The [Wan2.1 VAE upscale2x](https://huggingface.co/spacepxl/Wan2.1-VAE-upscale2x) checkpoint is a decoder-only finetune whose last conv emits 12 channels, pixel- shuffled into a 2x image (available in Forge Neo through [Neo-VAE-Utils](https://github.com/aoleg/Neo-VAE-Utils)). Measured with the real weights, on three 1536px inputs, lattice peak-to-peak in /255:

| input | input | 2x decode | 1x gaussian | 1x bilinear | 1x area | 1x lanczos |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Krea 2, gridded | 2.54 | 1.30 | 0.03 | 0.04 | 0.11 | 0.06 |
| Krea 2, degridded | 0.32 | 1.22 | 0.02 | 0.03 | 0.07 | 0.05 |
| Z-Image (Flux VAE) | 0.07 | 1.06 | 0.03 | 0.04 | 0.08 | 0.06 |

- **The lattice is made by the decoder, not carried in the latent.** A grid-free input produces the same 2x lattice as a gridded one, and a gridded input's lattice does not survive the encoder. Degridding before a re-encode only protects whatever reads the pixels in between (an upscaler, a restorer); the next Qwen decode always adds a fresh grid, which is why the Forge extension filters every decode rather than the final image.
- **At 2x the upscale decoder is gridded too**, at about half the stock amplitude, vertical stripes dominant, phase-locked across the whole frame. Use DeGrid after it. In Forge the two extensions compose on their own.
- **Downscaled back to 1x it is clean.** Every filter leaves at most 0.11/255 (area, a 2-tap box); gaussian and bilinear leave 0.02-0.04, and DeGrid reports `none detected` and passes the image through. The round trip reconstructs Wan-native content at 39-41 dB PSNR.

So for a plain decode the two routes reach the same place. The notch costs a few milliseconds and covers every decode path; the upscale decoder is a full decode at four times the pixel count, but also gives real 2x output when that is what you want.

A Flux.2 round trip on its own is a worse grid remover than the notch (0.29/255 left against 0.05, a faint checker of its own, ~34 dB of fidelity everywhere), so it is not offered as one. What the Flux.2 encoder *is* good for is the next section.

## VAE Enhance (Flux.2 round trip)

### Where the idea came from

The Qwen Image VAE that Krea 2, Qwen Image and Anima decode through has two reputations: it leaves the 2px grid this repo was written to remove, and it renders skin as smooth plastic. The Flux.2 VAE has the opposite reputation, fine detail and no grid. Since a VAE is just an encoder and a decoder, the question was whether a finished image could be pushed *through* the Flux.2 VAE as a post-process, encode then decode, and come back with its grid gone and its skin texture re-drawn. The first answer, from the literature, was no: a round trip is a reconstruction, the decoder reproduces whatever it is given, and smooth skin in means smooth skin out. The second answer, from experiments, was "not a round trip, but something close to one".

### What the research showed

Two measurements settled it. A five-VAE round trip of a real photo ([sheet](scr/research-five-vae-roundtrip.png): Flux 1, Flux 2, Qwen 1, Qwen 2.1 and Wan 2.1, eye region at 4x) confirmed that a plain round trip removes the grid but re-writes about half of the pore texture with its own version at the same energy, so it cannot restore anything that is not already there. It also showed that the stock Wan 2.1 decoder has no lattice at all, so the grid is a property of the Qwen fine-tune, not of the architecture. The operation that does add texture is *extrapolation*: encode the image, encode a slightly blurred copy, and decode the latent pushed away from the blurred one. The difference between the two latents is what the encoder considers fine detail, in the channel space where sub-8px structure actually lives, and the decoder renders the added energy as pores and strands rather than as the edge halo and uniform grain a pixel unsharp mask produces at the same energy. The first ladder on a Krea 2 portrait ([sheet](scr/research-first-ladder.png): original, round trip, gains 1 to 3, then the pixel unsharp mask at matched energy) fixed the working range: gain 0.5 draws pores, gain 1 tints and etches, gain 2 and above turns skin into worms and oil paint. Eight images later the defaults below were set, and two more findings shaped the design: the grid must be notched *before* the extrapolation, because blurring removes it and the difference would otherwise carry it back onto every flat wall, and a fixed gain amplifies regular fabric weave into moiré from about 0.75, which is why 0.5 is the default and not a starting point.

### What we made

An optional second tool in the same repo, on all three hosts: a **VAE Enhance** node in ComfyUI, a **VAE Enhance (Flux.2 round trip)** accordion in Forge Neo, and a **VAE Enhance** parameter group in SwarmUI. In plain terms it does this to each finished image, once:

1. Removes the 2px grid with the notch, whether or not VAE DeGrid is on. If DeGrid already ran, this step finds nothing and changes nothing.
2. Encodes the image and a 1px-blurred copy of it with the Flux.2 VAE.
3. Builds a mask that says where more texture is wanted: not on clean sky, not where the region already has plenty, and, by default, only where the colour is skin-like. The last rule is what leaves walls and floors alone, because by local texture a plastic cheek and a flat painted wall measure the same and only colour tells them apart.
4. Decodes the latent pushed away from the blurred one by the gain, through that mask.
5. Puts the input's own colour and shading back under the new detail, because the Flux.2 decoder shifts skin a few levels toward magenta on its own.

Two encodes and one decode, under a second at 1536px on a modern GPU, 160 MB of VRAM in bf16. The Flux.2 VAE file is the only thing to download.

In Forge Neo the two accordions sit side by side. VAE DeGrid runs inside every VAE decode, which is what cleans the hires-fix first pass before the upscaler sees it:

![VAE DeGrid accordion in Forge Neo](scr/vae-degrid.png)

VAE Enhance runs once per final image. The dropdown lists only files whose safetensors header is a Flux.2 VAE, by header rather than by name, and every control has its measured default:

![VAE Enhance accordion in Forge Neo](scr/vae-enhance.png)

Enable both. With only VAE Enhance on, a plain single-pass image comes out the same, but a hires-fix upscaler is still fed a gridded first pass. The status line in the console and in the image parameters says which case you are in: `input grid 2.73/255 removed first` means DeGrid was off, `input grid 0.05/255 (clean)` means it was on. Never select the Flux.2 VAE in the main *VAE / Text Encoder* selector: that replaces the checkpoint's VAE and breaks sampling.

In ComfyUI, wire **VAE Decode → VAE DeGrid → VAE Enhance → Save** with a **Load VAE** node holding `flux2-vae.safetensors` on the `vae` input, and use it once on the final image, never before an upscaler. The node shows the same status line and has a `mask` output, white where the gain went, which is the first thing to look at when a result is not what you expected:

```
texture 4.71 -> 4.98 /255 (+6%) · mask 11% (skin only) · gain 0.5 sigma 1 · input grid 2.73/255 removed first · output grid 0.16/255 · 0.8 s
```

### What it looks like

Each sheet is a set of native-pixel crops at 2x, from the test corpus. Columns, unless labelled otherwise: original decode, notched, then the enhancement at gain 0.5, 0.75 and 1 with the colour restored, then a pixel unsharp mask at gain 1 for comparison.

**Fur, in-focus head** ([sheet](scr/sheet-fur.png)). Gain 0.5 draws individual strands on the cat's head and crisps the whiskers and eyes; gain 1 etches. The pixel unsharp mask in the last column sharpens the strands that were there and adds nothing.

![fur](scr/sheet-fur.png)

**Dark skin with existing texture** ([sheet](scr/sheet-dark-skin.png)). Gain 0.5 refines the pores that are already there; from 0.75 the highlights turn into orange peel. This is the case the *texture target* is for: the gain fades out as a region approaches the target level.

![dark skin](scr/sheet-dark-skin.png)

**Fair skin with freckles** ([sheet](scr/sheet-freckles.png)). The freckles are kept at every gain, fine texture appears between them, and at gain 1 the skin takes on a cellular look.

![freckles](scr/sheet-freckles.png)

**Why the default is 0.5 and not higher** ([sheet](scr/sheet-gain.png)). The same face from a production run at gain 0.5 and 0.75, against the notched original. At 0.5 the cheek gets faint pores. At 0.75 the forehead and cheek grow a network of fine lines that reads as wrinkles, and the eyebrows pick up stray strokes. The mask weight on this face was 0.63, so the two runs applied effective gains of about 0.3 and 0.47, and the damage starts between them.

![gain 0.5 versus 0.75](scr/sheet-gain.png)

**A production pair** ([sheet](scr/sheet-production.png)). Columns: raw decode, notched, enhanced at the defaults, and the difference between enhanced and notched amplified 8x. On the face the difference is pore-scale texture; on the printed swimsuit it is confined to the edges of the print, because the skin-tone mask is zero there.

![production pair](scr/sheet-production.png)

**What Flux.2 does to film grain** ([sheet](scr/sheet-grain.png)). A sky region of a "1950s technicolor, film grain" prompt, with the high-pass amplified 6x below: raw decode, notched, and after the enhancement, where the mask is zero so this is a pure round trip. The diagonal mesh in the raw grain is the 2px lattice, and the notch removes it. The round trip re-renders the grain about 10 % stronger and slightly finer and leaves its statistics otherwise unchanged. If the grain looks more natural after the enhancement, that is the notch's doing.

![grain](scr/sheet-grain.png)

### Forge Neo details

The accordion runs once per image after the final decode (`postprocess_image_after_composite`), so hires fix and img2img are handled without configuration. It writes its settings as `VAE Enhance: vae=…;gain=…` and the status line as `VAE Enhance result`, both restored by the paste button. **Show mask** adds the weight map to the results.

### Settings

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `gain` | 0.5 | How far past the input to push the detail; 0 is a plain round trip. 0.5 is the only setting that improved or left alone every image in an eight-image test set. Skin and fur improve from 0.5; regular fabric weave (denim, upholstery) moirés from about 0.75; skin turns leathery from about 1. |
| `sigma` | 1 | Blur radius that defines "fine detail". 1px targets pores and fur; 2 pushes larger structure and brings 16px block artefacts in sooner. |
| `mask_floor` | 0.5 | Local texture (16px-block std of the 9px high-pass luma, /255) below which a region gets nothing. Block medians on notched Krea 2 decodes: clean sky 0.35, sand 1.4, flat painted wall 1.5, plastic skin 1.2–2, defocused fur 2, textured skin 3–6, fur/hair/fabric 7–16. The default only drops clean sky and keeps every kind of skin; 2.5–3.5 protects walls, sand and defocus, at the cost of plastic skin. 0 = off. |
| `texture_target` | 9 | Gain fades out linearly as a region approaches this texture level, so skin that already has pores is not pushed further. 0 = off. Turn it off for animals: in-focus fur sits above 9 and would be protected away. |
| `skin_only` | on | Multiply the mask by the skin-tone membership. Turn it off for animals and greyscale images (the status line then reads `mask 0%`). |
| `tone_fix` | on | Keep the input's colour and shading. Costs nothing; leave it on. |
| `degrid_first` (node) | on | Run the notch on the input. The Forge script always does. |
| `post_notch` | off | Run the notch again on the output. The Flux.2 decoder has a faint 2px checker of its own that grows with gain (0.06/255 at gain 0.5, 0.5 at gain 1 on a flat wall). Costs 2px texture in the enhanced result; only worth it above gain 0.75. |

Presets that worked: **portrait** = defaults; **animal** = `skin_only` off, `texture_target` 0, `mask_floor` 3 (protects the wall behind the cat).

### What it cannot do

- It cannot reduce texture. A round trip reproduces an over-textured decode to within 0.03/255 of high-frequency energy, and the extrapolation makes it stronger. For that case use the notch and pixel-space tools.
- It cannot tell regular fine texture from irregular by energy: denim and a sofa weave moiré from gain 0.75, fur does not. Keep the gain at 0.5 on images with such fabric, or mask them out upstream.
- It cannot tell defocus from plastic skin by energy either. With `skin_only` off, a defocused skin-coloured region gets faint texture from gain 0.75.
- Greyscale images get nothing with `skin_only` on.

### Tests

`python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` covers the maths against an identity codec with the Flux.2 geometry (so every latent-space step has an exact pixel-space equivalent), the mask terms, the Forge hook wiring and parameter round trip, and the header-based VAE detection, with no VAE file. The real VAE is exercised by

```
<forge-neo>/venv/Scripts/python.exe tests/live_flux2_check.py [--image some.png] [--gain 0.5] [--skin 0|1]
```

which builds the Flux.2 VAE from `<forge-neo>/models/VAE` through the Forge backend, checks the weights mapped (a plain round trip must reconstruct a synthetic image above 30 dB; the file ships in diffusers key naming and loads silently onto random weights, 14 dB, if the conversion is skipped), checks the texture response and the grid removal, and optionally writes the enhanced image and mask for a real file. No checkpoint is needed.

## Film emulation

The last stage before saving, off by default: film grain, then softness, halation, bloom and highlight roll-off. One core file, `film_emulation_core.py`, for all three hosts.

![Film emulation in Forge Neo](scr/film-emulation-screenshot.png)

### Why film grain

Part of it is taste. Film is a look people choose on purpose, and grain is the first thing that says "film".

The other part is perception. A clean decode looks plastic. The right amount of grain makes the same picture look sharper and more detailed, because the eye takes the fine texture for detail. Add too much, and perceived sharpness drops again.

The smooth-skin shot at 1:1: no grain, then ISO 200, 400 (the default) and 1600 at grain 50.

![film grain presets at grain 50](scr/sheet-film-emulation-grain.png)

### Why not prompt for it

Krea 2 draws film grain when asked. Sometimes it looks like film, often it does not, and it cannot be steered: the words that bring the grain also change the picture, and the amount and size are whatever the model decides. Nothing turns them up or down afterwards. For the renders used here I put `film grain, blurry` in the negative prompt to get clean images.

### Noise, grain and grading tools

Most grain extensions add noise: every pixel independent, the same size everywhere, often the same strength in every tone. That is a digital sensor. Film grain is developed silver, or dye clouds in colour film: blobs one to three pixels across that clump together, with size and count set by how much light reached each spot.

Grading tools with good film emulation exist. They are stand-alone: one more program, one more pass over every image, and overkill when all you need is a generated image that looks like film.

### Grain size follows exposure

Grain is stronger in the darks; most implementations get that far. Grain *size* changes across the frame too.

An emulsion holds silver halide crystals of many sizes, and a large crystal needs fewer photons to form a latent image than a small one. Where little light arrives, only the large crystals collect enough to develop, so underexposed areas show sparse, large, clumpy grains. Where plenty of light arrives, crystals of every size develop and their small grains overlap into a fine, even texture. In one frame, grain is always finer in the highlights and coarser wherever the film was underexposed.

So grain slapped on top won't look right if you're after the best reproduction. That holds for realistically rendered grain, for scans of real developed film, and for grain whose strength varies between dark and light areas, as long as its size stays the same across the frame.

Here, two noise fields from the same seed are blended by luma: 1.35 times the preset's blob size in the shadows, 1/1.35 in the highlights, with more clumping in the shadows. The blend is renormalised, so tone changes the size and clumping and leaves the amount alone.

The amount per tone comes from **Film type**:

- `print` (the default) for prints and reversal slides, which is what the model draws: the most grain in the shadows, 1.6 times the midtone amount at luma 0.22, about half that near black, a third at 0.80 and none from 0.95 up.
- `negative` for a negative scan: more in the highlights (1.3 times at 0.85), less in the shadows.

Near black and white, grain is held to half the distance to black or white, so it never clips.

The night street at 1:1: no grain, `print`, `negative`. Below it, a black-and-white street, detected as monochrome and given luma grain only.

![grain by tone, print against negative, and on a monochrome image](scr/sheet-film-emulation-tone.png)

**No grain on paper.** Grain lives in the emulsion. A uniform light band along at least three edges, with a busy picture inside, is a print or Polaroid border and comes out bit-exact. Flat, bright, grey patches inside the picture (paper white) get no grain either.

![a Polaroid border left untouched](scr/sheet-film-emulation-frame.png)

**Colour.** Luma grain adds the same value to R, G and B, so grey stays grey to the last bit. Colour grain varies the colour a pixel already has, in proportion to its saturation, and never moves the hue: a neutral wall gets none, a sepia print only varies its toning. An image with a mean chroma under 8/255 (a "B&W" decode with a slight cast) counts as monochrome and gets luma grain only. **Colour grain** `auto` does exactly that; `off` forces luma grain on any image; `on` allows colour grain on a faintly tinted image.

### Beyond grain

Grain alone on a digital render looks like grained digital. Film is also about what light does inside the camera, and four optical stages add that. Each is 0 to 100, off at 0, and runs before the grain, because grain sits in the emulsion and is never blurred or glowed.

- **Halation.** Bright light passes through the emulsion, reflects off the film base and exposes the red-sensitive layer next to the base a second time: a red-orange glow around lamps, windows and speculars, strongest on film without an anti-halation layer (CineStill). It is keyed on luminance or red, whichever is higher, so a red neon halates and a blue light hardly does. Neutral on monochrome images. Radius 0.6 and 2 percent of the long side.
- **Bloom.** A wide, soft glow in the light's own colour, as from a diffusion filter or lens glare, at 2 and 8 percent of the long side. At 50, a haze around backlit hair; at 100, the picture washes out.
- **Softness.** A lens and an emulsion resolve less than a render. A blend toward a 1 px Gaussian, scaled with image size like the grain.
- **Highlight roll-off.** Film bends into a shoulder where a render clips. The brightest channel is compressed from sRGB 0.70 up, hue kept; pure white lands at about 237/255 at 25, 226 at 50 and 214 at 100. It also takes the light halation and bloom push past white.

Halation and bloom add only the glow in excess of its source: a uniform bright area gets nothing, a lamp keeps its brightness, the dark surroundings get the whole glow. Softness, halation and bloom work in linear light. A detected border is left out of all four: they run on the picture inside it, so paper never glows into the picture.

Each stage at 50, grain off: softness on the face, halation around the lamp, bloom around the backlit hair, roll-off on the studio backdrop.

![softness, halation, bloom and highlight roll-off at 50](scr/sheet-film-emulation-optics.png)

### Calibration

Everything was judged by eye, grain at 1:1, on clean renders.

- **Grain scale.** Anchored on the midtone just-noticeable difference of about 3/255, at mid grey (luma 0.45): grain 1 is 0.3/255, under the threshold; 50 is 3.3/255, at it, where grain reads as texture; 100 is 8/255, visibly noisy. The model's own prompted grain measures about 4/255, grain 60.
- **ISO character.** The presets were first fitted to the grain Krea 2 draws when prompted: a neighbour correlation of 0.34 after a 9 px high-pass, 0.35 for the matching preset. Then I compared them with my own film stock. That look is ISO 400 on cheap film, ISO 800 on expensive film, so every preset moved up a stop. ISO 400 is the default, ISO 6400 is the old 3200, and ISO 100 is extrapolated and was never judged by eye.
- **Equal loudness.** Coarse, clumpy grain looks louder than fine grain of the same amplitude. ISO 200, 1600 and 6400 were matched against ISO 400 at grain 50 and 100: a ladder of amplitudes per preset, and the rung that looks as loud as the reference wins. The picks follow the square root of the blob size, and that rule sets the other presets.
- **Size against resolution.** The blob size grows with the square root of the long side: 0.82 times at 1024 px, 1.15 times at 2048. Scaled in full proportion, a 1536 px image looked a step coarser at 100 percent than a 1024 px one; unscaled, a large image's grain vanishes at fit-to-screen.
- **Tone curve.** The `print` peak first sat at luma 0.10, and a dark night sky sparkled. It moved to 0.22, with half the amount near black.
- **Textured images.** Texture an image already has hides part of the added grain: the visibility threshold rises with the contrast underneath, with a slope of about 0.6. With **Same visible grain on textured images** on (the default), the stage measures the texture floor, the quietest tenth of the picture's midtone areas. Up to 1.1/255 the image counts as clean and gets exactly the setting's amount; above that, the amount rises with the floor to the power 0.6, to at most 1.4 times and 12/255. The first version went the other way and lowered the grain on clean renders, which made grain 50 invisible exactly where grain is needed. The cap started at 2; night scenes reached it first and, with the dark weighting on top, put 11/255 into the shadows.
- **Optics.** Ladders of 0, 25, 50 and 100, with a difference row under each rung. The first set changed up to a third of the pixels by more than 8/255 and still could not be seen: renders already draw a glow around their lights, and an added glow no wider or redder than that one, or a shoulder above sRGB 0.85, leaves the same picture. After a retune, the look I picked sat at 25; the scales were halved to put it at 50, and 100 is too much on purpose.

| image | texture floor | factor | grain 50 gives |
|---|---|---|---|
| crisp, clean 1536 px render | 0.45/255 | 1.00 | 3.3/255 |
| smooth-skin portrait | 1.23/255 | 1.07 | 3.5/255 |
| cat on a sofa | 2.14/255 | 1.40 | 4.6/255 |
| night street | 6.73/255 | 1.40 | 4.6/255 |

| ISO | blob size at a 1536 px long side, highlights to shadows | neighbour correlation at mid grey | kurtosis | colour grain | amplitude at grain 50 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | 0.24-0.43 px | 0.05 | 3.2 | 3 % | 4.2/255 |
| 200 | 0.30-0.54 px | 0.15 | 3.2 | 5 % | 3.8/255 |
| 400 (default) | 0.37-0.68 px | 0.29 | 3.3 | 8 % | 3.3/255 |
| 800 | 0.44-0.81 px | 0.42 | 3.4 | 12 % | 3.0/255 |
| 1600 | 0.56-1.01 px | 0.57 | 3.6 | 18 % | 2.7/255 |
| 3200 | 0.70-1.28 px | 0.69 | 3.9 | 25 % | 2.4/255 |
| 6400 | 0.89-1.62 px | 0.77 | 4.1 | 35 % | 2.2/255 |

The fitted preset measures 0.29 at mid grey today: it was fitted as a single field, before grain size followed exposure.

### Where it goes

Last. A resize, an upscaler or a re-encode after it resamples the grain into blobs twice the size or averages it away.

- **ComfyUI:** wire the **Film Emulation** node straight into Save, after VAE DeGrid and VAE Enhance if you use them.
- **Forge Neo:** the **Film emulation** accordion runs on each final image after the other two accordions, never on the hires-fix first pass, and works with them off. It writes `Film emulation: iso=ISO400;grain=50;chroma=auto;match=1;film=print;soft=0;halation=0;bloom=0;rolloff=0` and a `Film emulation result` line to the parameters. Images made before the rename, with `Film grain: ...;strength=...`, restore into it too.
- **SwarmUI:** the **Film Emulation** group runs after the other two steps on the final decode.

The grain seed is the image's own generation seed: a batch gets different grain per image, a re-run gets the same. The status line reports the applied and measured midtone amplitude, the texture match, the blob sizes, the colour decision, the optics in use, a detected border and the seed. A clean render, the night street with optics, a Polaroid:

```
grain ISO 400 strength 50 · 3.3/255 midtone (measured 3.4) · x1.00 for texture floor 0.68/255 · blob 0.39-0.72 px · colour grain 8% · seed 42
grain ISO 400 strength 50 · 4.6/255 midtone (measured 5.0) · x1.40 for texture floor 5.88/255 · blob 0.39-0.72 px · colour grain 8% · softness 25 halation 50 bloom 25 roll-off 50 · seed 42
grain ISO 400 strength 50 · 4.4/255 midtone (measured 4.7) · x1.33 for texture floor 1.78/255 · blob 0.39-0.72 px · colour grain 8% · frame excluded 104/351/83/78 px · seed 42
```

Judge grain at 100 percent: a downscaled preview hides it and 2:1 exaggerates it. Judge the optics on the whole picture. With everything on, a 1280x1728 image takes about 0.25 s on a CPU and 0.03 s on a GPU.

### Tests

`tests/test_film_emulation.py` covers the grain scale, equal loudness across ISO, both tone curves, coarser and clumpier grain in the shadows, the renormalised blend, the headroom near black and white, grey staying grey, sepia keeping its hue, the monochrome detector, the texture match, the border detector (exact on a Polaroid, silent on a plain photo and on a sky along one edge) and paper white. For the optics: all at 0 equals the grain-only result, softness moves light without adding any, halation is red around a light and neutral on monochrome, a red light halates and a blue one does not, bloom keeps its source's colour and never lands on a bright backdrop or inside a lamp, the roll-off is a monotone, hue-keeping shoulder, and a border stays bit-exact with every stage at 100. The node and the Forge script have their own wiring tests, including the paste of old `Film grain:` infotexts.

## SwarmUI

SwarmUI's backend is a real ComfyUI, so this side of the repo does not reimplement anything: a small C# extension installs this repo's own node pack on the backend and wires the **VAE DeGrid** node into the generated workflow.

### Install

Clone into SwarmUI's `src/Extensions` folder and restart (or run the update script):

```
cd <SwarmUI>/src/Extensions
git clone https://github.com/aoleg/ComfyUI-DeGrid
```

Then, in the generate tab, open the **VAE DeGrid** parameter group (advanced parameters must be on) and click **Install VAE DeGrid**. That clones this same repo into the backend's `DLNodes` folder as the ComfyUI node pack and restarts the backend. The node and the extension are therefore always the same commit.

### Use

Tick the **VAE DeGrid** group. Its four parameters are the node's: **Mode**, **Limit** (manual mode), **Skip When Clean** and **Clean Threshold** (/255). The settings are written into the image metadata as `degrid`.

Where the node goes in the workflow:

- **After the final VAE decode**, before segmentation, video steps and SeedVR, which is the order the ComfyUI section above asks for. Output from a Pixel Decoder model or from Neo-VAE-Utils' upscaling decoder also arrives here and is measured like anything else: the former is skipped as clean, the latter has its own 2px lattice removed.
- **After the refiner's decode when the refiner upscales in pixel space** (upscale method `pixel-*` or `model-*`), so the upscaler, the intermediate save and the re-encode all see a degridded image. Latent-space refiner upscales never decode, so there is nothing to do there.

Video outputs are left alone in this version. The backend log shows one `[DeGrid] grid ...` line per node run; SwarmUI does not display node text, so that line is where the measurement is.

### VAE Enhance in SwarmUI

A second parameter group, **VAE Enhance**, served by the same node pack (the install button on either group installs it). Put `flux2-vae.safetensors` in the VAE models folder, refresh the model list, tick the group and pick the file in **[VAE Enhance] Flux.2 VAE**; Flux.2-classed VAEs are listed first. The other parameters are the node's (`gain`, `sigma`, mask floor and target, skin tones only, keep input colour, notch again after), with the same defaults and the same meaning as in the [settings table](#settings).

Where it goes: **once, right after VAE DeGrid on the final decode** (priority 1.6, after DeGrid's 1.5), never in the refiner path, so an upscaler is never fed re-drawn strands and the fidelity cost is paid once. The node runs the notch on its input itself, so the grid is removed first whether or not the VAE DeGrid group is on; with it on, that inner pass finds a clean image and skips. The Flux.2 VAE is loaded through SwarmUI's own VAE loader helper and is used only for this round trip; the checkpoint's VAE still decodes the image. The settings are written to the image metadata as `vae_enhance`, and the backend log shows one `[DeGrid] texture ...` line per image.

If the group is on and no VAE is selected the generation stops with a message saying so. A node pack that predates VAE Enhance is reported on backend refresh by the same version check that covers the DeGrid node.

### Film Emulation in SwarmUI

A third parameter group, **Film Emulation**, on the same node pack: **ISO**, **Grain**, **Colour Grain**, **Same Visible Grain On Textured Images** and **Film Type**, then **Softness**, **Halation**, **Bloom** and **Highlight Roll-Off**, with the meaning and defaults of the [Film emulation](#film-emulation) section. It is inserted after VAE DeGrid and VAE Enhance on the final decode, never in the refiner path, and does not need either of the other groups to be on. The seed is the generation's seed. The settings are written to the image metadata as `film_emulation`, and the backend log shows one `[DeGrid] grain ...` line per image. A node pack that predates Film Emulation is reported on backend refresh.

### Notes

- **Version check.** ComfyUI silently ignores inputs a node does not declare. On every backend refresh the extension compares the installed node's inputs with the ones it sends and logs a warning naming anything missing, for example a `DLNodes` clone that predates the `threshold` input, or a `VAEDeGrid` node supplied by [ComfyUI-SaveSimple](https://github.com/lunaaispace-eng/ComfyUI-SaveSimple) instead of this repo.
- **Two clones of this repo are expected.** One under `src/Extensions` (the C# extension), one under the backend's `DLNodes` (the node pack). SwarmUI compiles the `DLNodes` copy of the `.cs` file into its core assembly as well, so the extension is prepped twice at startup; a process-wide guard makes the second init a no-op. Two `Prepping extension` lines in the log are normal.

## How it works

A separable Nyquist notch: 9-tap alternating-sign binomial kernel (1D response sin⁸(ω/2)), combined as `center − Bx − By + Bxy`, which factors into `(1 − sin⁸(ωx/2))(1 − sin⁸(ωy/2))`. That is an exact zero for any 2px-period pattern — vertical stripes, horizontal stripes, or checkerboard — and exact unity at DC with an 8th-order flat zero, so gradients pass through without banding.

The correction is then amplitude-clamped before subtraction, so strong real edges and legitimate fine texture pass through unsoftened — only the low-amplitude artifact band is removed. In `auto` mode the clamp limit is a smooth per-pixel map. The image is split into 256px tiles; in each, the limit starts from a robust percentile of the extracted grid component and is raised until the lattice that would survive the clamp there is under half the clean threshold (or the 0.05 ceiling is reached), and the tile limits are then bilinearly blended so the clamp has no seams. The survivor is measured exactly, without a second filter pass: the sublattice means are linear, so the lattice left in the cleaned image equals the lattice in the part of the correction the clamp cut off.

Per-tile calibration matters because the grid is not uniform: it rides on texture. On a Qwen Image 2.1 desert scene it measured 0.7/255 in the sky and 8.8/255 on the ground, and the tile map settles at 0.005–0.007 over the sky and 0.05 over the ground, where one frame-wide limit had been 0.05 everywhere. What the map cannot do is separate detail from a grid that sits on that same detail: the dry twigs carry a 3/255 lattice themselves, so their tiles keep a high cap and lose the same few percent of 2px-band energy either way. The protection is for the regions that do not need the high cap. Krea 2 decodes settle at the first or second step; Qwen Image 2.1 decodes carry a heavier tail in the notch band and their textured tiles climb to 0.03–0.05.

Separately from the clamp, the node decides *whether there is a grid at all* by measuring the phase-locked lattice (see **Status line** above). Measured across Qwen Image 2.1 outputs, that separates cleanly by about 10×: native VAE decodes read 1.6–2.0/255, the same images after an upscaler read 0.10–0.20/255, and a pure-noise control reads 0.05/255. Below the 0.5/255 threshold the filter is skipped entirely rather than run at a small setting, because the notch is cheap but not free — on a clean, detailed image it still shaves roughly 1/255 of real high-frequency detail.

Based on the GLSL notch-filter approach shared by [u/Haiku-575 on r/StableDiffusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1umwhq7/2px_pixel_grid_on_krea2_from_vae_and_how_to/), reimplemented in pure PyTorch with a narrower 9-tap kernel, amplitude limiting, and per-image auto-calibration.

## Changelog

### 2026-10-04 (film emulation)

- **Film Emulation replaces Film Grain.** The stage is renamed on every host (node `FilmEmulation`, Forge accordion **Film emulation**, SwarmUI group **Film Emulation**, files `film_emulation_core.py` and `scripts/film_emulation_forge.py`) because it now holds more than grain. The grain amount is now called `grain` (was `strength`). Forge images made before the rename, with `Film grain: ...`, still restore into the new accordion.
- **Grain follows the tone.** Grain is coarse and clumpy in the shadows and fine in the highlights, as on film, where an underexposed area develops only the largest crystals. A new **film type** sets the amount per tone: `print` (the default, for prints and reversal slides) puts the most in the darks and none on pure black or white, `negative` (a scan) puts more in the highlights.
- **No grain on white borders.** A Polaroid or print border is detected and left bit-exact, and flat paper white inside the picture gets no grain.
- **The same amount at every ISO**, matched by eye; the presets used to read louder as they got coarser.
- **ISO names checked against real film stock.** The look that was called ISO 200 is ISO 400 on cheap film, so every preset moved up one stop, ISO 6400 was added and ISO 100 extrapolated. The default is ISO 400, the same look as before.
- **Texture match limit 1.4 times instead of 2.** Night scenes reached 2 times and, with the extra grain in the darks, came out speckled.
- **Optical stages:** softness, halation, bloom and highlight roll-off, each 0 to 100 and off by default, before the grain. See [Beyond grain](#beyond-grain).

### 2026-10-04

- **Film grain: same visible grain on textured images** (new control, on by default). Texture an image already has hides part of the grain added to it, so textured and already grainy images now get more grain, up to double, to show as much as a clean image does; clean renders get exactly the strength's amount. A first version of this control, briefly on `main`, did the opposite and scaled grain *down* on clean renders, which made the default invisible on exactly the images that need grain most. See [Film emulation](#film-emulation).
- **Film grain: gentler size scaling.** The blob size now grows with the square root of the image's long side instead of in proportion, so a preset looks the same at 100 percent across sizes (1536 against 1024: 1.22 times instead of 1.5).
- **Film grain: status line without commas.** "monochrome, luma grain only" made Forge write the whole `Film grain result` value in quotes; it now reads "monochrome (luma grain only)".

### 2026-10-03

- **Film Grain.** A third optional tool on all three hosts, sharing `film_grain_core.py`: seeded, correlated, midtone-weighted grain as the last stage before saving. ISO presets set the character (blob size, clumpiness, colour) and were calibrated against the grain Krea 2 draws when prompted for it, which ISO 200, the default, matches; strength sets the amplitude in /255 units anchored on the midtone visibility threshold. Luma grain is exactly neutral and colour grain only varies the colour a pixel already has, so monochrome and toned images never get colour blotches. See [Film emulation](#film-emulation).
- `lib_degrid/loader.py` gained `load_grain_core()`; the SwarmUI version check covers the third node.

### 2026-09-22

- **VAE Enhance.** A second node (**VAE Enhance (Flux.2 round trip)**) and a second Forge Neo accordion, sharing `vae_enhance_core.py`: detail extrapolation through the Flux.2 VAE encoder for plastic skin and soft fur, with the notch run first, a floor / target / skin-tone mask and a tone fix. See [VAE Enhance](#vae-enhance-flux2-round-trip) for the measurements behind the defaults and for what it cannot do.
- **SwarmUI: VAE Enhance group.** `DeGridExtension.cs` registers a second parameter group with a Flux.2 VAE picker and inserts the node after the final-decode DeGrid step (priority 1.6), never in the refiner path; the version check now covers both nodes. See [VAE Enhance in SwarmUI](#vae-enhance-in-swarmui).
- `lib_degrid/flux2_vae.py`: Forge-side Flux.2 VAE detection by safetensors header and loading with the diffusers-to-ldm key conversion the official file needs. `lib_degrid/loader.py` gained `load_enhance_core()`.
- `tests/live_flux2_check.py`: an end-to-end check through the real VAE using a Forge Neo venv (no checkpoint).

### 2026-09-21

- **Forge Neo extension.** The same node, as a `VAE DeGrid` accordion in [Forge Neo](#forge-neo). It filters inside the VAE decode rather than after it, so the hires-fix first pass is cleaned before the upscaler sees it. Adds a `Clean threshold` control (the node keeps its fixed 0.5/255).
- `degrid_core.degrid()` takes an optional `threshold` (default unchanged), and the status-line text moved into `degrid_core.status_line()` so every front end describes a result in the same words. Cleaned images are identical to before.
- The status line now says **partially removed** when the clamp limit was too low to subtract the whole grid, with the residual amplitude, instead of claiming "removed" for whatever the detector saw. `stats` gains `residual_255`. The `edges protected` figure lost its colon so Forge does not quote the value in the parameters.
- README: measured the Wan2.1 VAE upscale2x decoder as an alternative to degridding (see [Swapping the decoder instead](#swapping-the-decoder-instead)): gridded at 2x, clean after its own downscale to 1x; the lattice comes from the decoder, not the latent.
- **SwarmUI extension.** `DeGridExtension.cs` at the repo root, see [SwarmUI](#swarmui): the node is inserted after the final decode and after a pixel-space refiner decode, with a version check against the installed node.
- **Node: optional `threshold` input** (/255, default 0.5), the control Forge already had, so all three hosts share one parameter surface. The node also prints its status line to the backend console.
- **RGBA decodes** (Qwen Image 2.1) are filtered on colour only; alpha passes through untouched and is excluded from the measurement.
- **Auto mode now targets the residual.** On Qwen Image 2.1 decodes the percentile-based limit (0.009) capped nearly a tenth of the pixels and left 0.7/255 of a 1.9/255 grid in place; the status line said so, and now auto acts on it. The limit is raised in 1.5× steps up to 0.05 until the lattice left behind is under half the clean threshold. Krea 2 results move by at most one step.
- **Auto mode is local.** The calibration runs per 256px tile and the tile limits are blended into a per-pixel map (never below a tile's own value), because the grid rides on texture: 0.7/255 in a Qwen 2.1 sky, 8.8/255 on the ground of the same image, and one frame-wide limit high enough for the ground applied the same 0.05 cap to the sky. The status line reports the range of tile limits; `stats` gain `limit_min` and `limit_max`. Manual mode is unchanged.

**In short:** the filter was fine — the thing deciding *when to run it* was broken.

The node used to report how much fine detail an image had and call that "the grid". Those are not the same thing, so it got it backwards: on a real test set it called the cleanest image the most gridded one. And because it never really knew whether a grid was there, it filtered everything, always — quietly scraping a little genuine texture off images that had no grid at all.

It now measures the grid itself. A VAE grid lands on the same pixel positions across the whole frame, so averaging those positions keeps the grid while ordinary detail cancels out. Gridded images measure about 1.6–2.0/255, grid-free ones about 0.1 — a wide, unambiguous gap. If there is no grid, the image is now passed through **completely untouched**, which matters most for anything that has already been through an upscaler or a resize.

**The maths that removes the grid did not change.** On an image that really has a grid you get exactly the same result as before.

The detail, for anyone who wants it:

- **Qwen Image 2.1 confirmed affected.** It ships a genuinely different VAE — `modelspec.architecture: qwen_image_2.1_vae`, a 64-channel latent and four spatial upsample stages, against 16 channels and three for the Qwen-Image / Wan 2.1 VAE — so it compresses considerably harder. The artifact is nonetheless the **same 2px lattice**, measured on native decodes at 1.6–2.0/255 with checkerboard and both stripe orientations at comparable strength. That is expected: the period of this artifact is set by the stride of the *final* upsample stage, which is still 2, not by how deep the VAE is or how wide its latent is. There is no 16px "latent grid" to chase even though the VAE now compresses 16× — a phase-fold sweep over periods 5–12 shows only the even-period harmonics of the 2px component, and an exact-bin comb test reads flat at p=4/8/16/32.
- **Fixed a backwards grid detector.** The reported `grid ≈ X/255` was the 75th percentile of the filter's own correction, which measures how *detailed* an image is rather than how gridded — on real files it read higher on the cleanest image than on the most gridded one. It is now a phase-locked lattice measurement. The notch, the clamp and the auto limit are unchanged, so results on images that do have a grid are identical to before.
- **New `skip_when_clean` widget (default on).** An image with no lattice is now passed through bit-for-bit instead of being quietly filtered. Previously every grid-free image lost ~0.7–1.1/255 mean (up to 4.5/255 peak) of genuine high-frequency detail for nothing.
- Status line now names the dominant orientation and no longer claims to have removed a grid that was not there.
